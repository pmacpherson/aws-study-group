# AWS Study Group

An informal weekly study group where a group of individuals get together to study a common topic, in this case Amazon Web Services.

Each week, we will tackle a specific problem.  We can pair up with another individual, or work independently, and work on that problem together.  This study group is a self-taught study group, so you will get as much as you put into it.

If you have suggestions for weekly problems, let us know.  We'll add it to the list.

# AWS Study Group Rules

There are 4 rules to this amazon study group:

## Help Others (Not yourself)

No one should go into a study group expecting other people to help them. They should go into the group looking to help other people.

When a person understands something better than everyone else, they teach what they know. 
When a person doesn’t understand something, they work to learn it. 
Both teaching and learning will help you understand the subject better.

## Share Ideas

One of the greatest advantages to having a study group is the extra sets of eyes you get to take advantage of.

Everyone sees something different. By getting multiple perspectives, you get to choose the one that you think is best.

## Don’t Be A Dick

Since we focus on revolving between student and teacher roles, everyone is going to have their own "stupid moments."

It’s okay to have fun with other people and make jokes but if they don't think it's funny, then you are simply being a dick.

## This is not billable time.

You are responsible for your own schedules and ensuring you meet work expectations.  This is not a billable project and does not count towards your billable time.  You are here voluntarily during your lunch break.  Please track the time accordingly.
